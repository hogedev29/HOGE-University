<p>
  HOGE is a community deflationary currency. There will never be more HOGE in
  circulation than there is now. Every time a transaction takes place with
  HOGE, 1% of that transaction is removed or “burned” from the total supply.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>This increases the scarcity of every HOGE in circulation. </strong>
  Additionally, another 1% is distributed among every HOGE holder. What this
  means is that every time HOGE is used, the value of the remaining HOGE in
  circulation is increased by simultaneously decreasing the supply
  (deflation), while also distributing HOGE to everyone using the token. As a
  result, every single HOGE holder has an incentive to spread the use of HOGE
  as much as possible.
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Note</p>
    As more transactions take place in the network, the individual net-worth
    of all who own a piece of the network increases as well.
