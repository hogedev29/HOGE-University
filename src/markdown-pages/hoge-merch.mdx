  <h3>Hoge is a community deflationary coin</h3>
  <p>
    HOGE is a deflationary currency. There will never be more HOGE in
    circulation than there is now. Every time a transaction takes place with
    HOGE, 1% of that transaction is removed or “burned” from the total supply.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>This increases the scarcity of every HOGE</strong> in circulation.
    Additionally, another 1% is distributed among every HOGE holder. What this
    means is that every time HOGE is used, the value of the remaining HOGE in
    circulation is increased by simultaneously decreasing the supply
    (deflation), while also distributing HOGE to everyone using the token. As a
    result, every single HOGE holder has an incentive to spread the use of HOGE
    as much as possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      As more transactions take place in the network, the individual net-worth
      of all who own a piece of the network increases as well.
    </strong>
